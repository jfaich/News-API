When cloning this repo, in order for it to run successfully, you will have to create your own files to connect to it's databases (test and development).

Start by adding the following two files to the project files:

1. '.env.test'
2. '.env.development'

When you've added these files:
In the '.env.test' file you've created, add a line that reads:
'PGDATABASE=nc_news_test'

In the '.env.development' file you've created, add a line that reads:
'PGDATABASE=nc_news'

When you've done this, you're all set.
